# Week 1 Plan

## Goals
- Establish baseline understanding of the SmartGlass AI Agent architecture and dependencies.
- Validate cloud-based contribution workflow by raising at least one pull request.
- Prioritize immediate documentation and onboarding improvements from initial findings.

## Data Access Layer (DAL)

```
Wearable Sensors -> Provider Adapter -> DAL Interface -> Agent Pipelines
                          ^                 |
                          |                 v
                  Mock + Meta Stubs   Telemetry + SDK Shims
```

- **Providers:**
  - `mock` (default offline provider used in CI and documentation examples)
  - `meta` (preview stub mirroring the Ray-Ban wearable SDK shape)

| Provider | Telemetry | Vision Frames | Audio Stream | Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `mock`   | ✅ Logged to local fixtures | ✅ Deterministic sample clips | ✅ Synthetic speech packets | Stable for unit + integration tests |
| `meta`   | ⚠️ Stub responses only | ⚠️ Placeholder frame envelopes | ⚠️ No live audio yet | Mirrors expected API surface for upcoming SDK drop |

## CI “Wearables SDK” Preview

Continuous integration publishes a **Wearables SDK** summary artifact that aggregates mock-provider runs. To read it:

1. Open the latest CI run and locate the **Wearables SDK** job.
2. Download the `wearables_sdk_summary.json` artifact.
3. Inspect the `providers` block to confirm mock fixture coverage and compare it with the `meta` stub expectations for deltas.
4. Record any contract drift in the Week 1 notes to feed the thin adapter backlog.

## Exit Criteria
- A merged or reviewed pull request demonstrating the end-to-end PR workflow.
- Documented insights about onboarding friction and documentation gaps.
- Agreed backlog of next steps for Week 2 based on Week 1 observations.

## Risks
- SDK API churn could invalidate early integrations during the preview window.
- Preview limits may hide runtime edge cases until physical hardware access is restored.
- Limited access to required hardware or cloud services could block validation tasks.
- Unclear ownership may delay PR reviews.
- CI pipeline instability could slow feedback cycles.

### Mitigations
- Maintain a thin adapter around the Wearables SDK so provider swaps only touch a single seam.
- Extend the mock provider to capture expected preview gaps and keep tests runnable without hardware.

## Daily Notes

### Day 1
- Audit existing documentation and tooling to understand current workflows.
- Identify required stakeholders for reviews and approvals.

### Day 2
- Draft updated contribution guidelines reflecting the PR-driven model.
- Inventory CI jobs and note required credentials or secrets.

### Day 3
- Submit a documentation-focused PR through the web interface to validate workflow.
- Capture friction points encountered during submission.

### Day 4
- Review CI feedback from the submitted PR and document remediation steps.
- Coordinate with reviewers to confirm expectations and service-level targets.

### Day 5
- Finalize Week 1 findings and prepare recommendations for Week 2 planning.
- Update roadmap and backlog items based on validated learnings.
